 - Example: Instead of “Detailed Instructions on How to Install the Software”, use “Software Installation”.

2. Use Consistent Formatting
 - Maintain Hierarchical Consistency: Keep a consistent structure for headings and subheadings. For example, all main headings should have the same style (e.g., bold and large font), and subheadings should be a step down in size or style.
 - Example: H1 for main topics, H2 for subtopics, H3 for detailed subtopics, etc.

3. Be Descriptive
 - Convey the Purpose: Ensure headings describe the content that follows, so readers know exactly what to expect.
 - Example: Instead of using vague headings like “General Info,” use “System Requirements” or “Installation Steps.”

4. Keep It Action-Oriented (Where Appropriate)
 - Use Active Language: When possible, make headings action-oriented to show what the reader will do or learn.
 - Example: “Troubleshoot Network Issues” is more engaging than “Network Troubleshooting.”

5. Use Parallel Structure
 - Maintain Consistency in Grammar: When writing subheadings, keep the grammatical structure the same throughout. If one subheading starts with a verb, others should too.
 Example:
  - “Configure Settings”
  - “Troubleshoot Errors”
  - “Test System Performance”

6. Avoid Overloading with Keywords
 - Don’t Overstuff with Jargon: While headings should be descriptive, avoid using too many technical terms that might confuse the reader. Keep it simple and straightforward.
 - Example: Instead of “Exploring the Integration of Web APIs in Cloud-Hosted Applications,” try “Integrating Web APIs in the Cloud.”

7. Keep the Audience in Mind
 - Consider Your Audience: Tailor your headings to the technical knowledge of your audience. For non-technical readers, use simple and easy-to-understand language. For experts, you can afford to be more technical.
 Example:
  - For beginners: “How to Set Up Your Account”
  - For experts: “Configuring User Roles and Permissions”

8. Use Questions (If Appropriate)
 - Engage the Reader: Framing headings as questions can engage the reader and make the content feel more interactive.
 - Example: “How Do I Install the Software?” or “What Are the System Requirements?”

9. Avoid Being Too Vague
 - Be Specific: Vague headings may confuse the reader or make it hard to find the relevant information. Be as specific as possible without making the heading overly long.
 - Example: “Troubleshooting” could be too broad; a better heading might be “How to Fix Login Errors.”

10. Use Lists in Subheadings When Appropriate
 - Subheadings as Lists: If a section contains multiple points or steps, structure the subheading to reflect that.
 - Example: Instead of “Setting Up Your Device,” use “Setting Up Your Device: 3 Easy Steps.”

11. Prioritize Important Topics First
 - Place Key Information Early: Ensure that the most critical topics or processes appear first in the headings. This helps readers identify where to focus their attention.
 - Example: If a document is about a product’s installation, prioritize a section like “Installation Steps” before moving to “Troubleshooting.”

12. Use Headings to Break Up Dense Text
 - Improve Readability: Use headings and subheadings to break up long sections of text and avoid overwhelming the reader.
 - Example: If you’re explaining a technical process, break it into smaller sections like “Overview,” “Step 1: Install Dependencies,” and “Step 2: Run Setup Script.”
